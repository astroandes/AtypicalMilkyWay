* [Does the Milky Way Obey Spiral Galaxy Scaling Relations?](https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.05769) The expected Rd for the MW 
from the LVR relation is ∼5 kpc, nearly twice as large as the observed value, with error estimates placing the two in 
tension at the ∼1.4σ level. The compact scale length of the Galactic disk could be related to other ways in which the 
MW has been found to be anomalous.
